## OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT

## PROJECT:SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM

## Objective:
To design and implement a weather monitoring station using an Arduino Uno that measures and displays key atmospheric parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The system will collect real-time data from various sensors, process the data using the Arduino Uno, and present it in a user-friendly format on a local display or through serial output. Additionally, the system will be capable of recording and logging this data for further analysis.

## Detailed Goals:


**1 Measure Temperature and Humidity:**

*Use a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor to accurately measure the ambient temperature and humidity.


*Display the readings on a connected LCD or OLED display and/or send them to the Serial Monitor.


**2 Measure Atmospheric Pressure:**

*Utilize a BMP180 or BMP280 sensor to measure the atmospheric pressure.


*Display the pressure readings on a connected LCD or OLED display and/or send them to the Serial Monitor.


**3 Data Logging:**

*Optionally, log the collected data to an SD card for long-term storage and historical analysis.


**4 User Interface:**

*Provide a clear and simple user interface for displaying real-time data. This could be through an LCD/OLED screen or via the Serial Monitor.


**5 System Reliability:**


*Ensure the system operates reliably in various environmental conditions, with accurate and consistent data collection.





**6 Budget and Timeline:** 


*Establish a budget and timeline for the project, including hardware, software, and development costs.
